## Task 4 - extension B

Here you can find the trained models with the several Losses for the extension B of task 4, each of them trained for 30 epoches.

Here a list of the Loss used:
- Cross Entropy (ce)
- Logit Normalization (ln)
- Jaccard (jl)
- Focal Loss (fl)
- Jointly: Logit Normalization and Cross Entropy (ln ce)
- Jointly: Jaccard and Cross Entropy (jl ce)
- Jointly: Logit Normalization and Focal Loss (ln fl)
- Jointly: Jaccard and Focal Loss (jl fl)
